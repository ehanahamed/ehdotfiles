# Pipewire, audio, pulseaudio, & bluetooth

Installed `pipewire`, `wireplumber`, `pipewire-audio`, and `pipewire-pulse` (pacman)

`pipewire-pulse` replaces anything that works with pulse, so `pulsemixer`, for example, works with pipewire now!

bluetooth should also work out of the box

you can remove pulseaudio and related packages, cause pipewire replaces them
